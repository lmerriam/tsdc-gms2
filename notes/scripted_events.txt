Go pick up that one to the right.

Wait...
Why are you not dead?

-- BANG

If we survive the next few minutes then I'll have time to be amazed.

-- BANG

Almost through.
See that barrel over to the right?
If you really can use that boomstick hit it when they come in.

-- BANG

*Enemies pour in, player defeats them

Let's go visit the one person who can explain you being here.

* Bright outer area
* Quest marker to first town

* Player encounters enemies and defeats them
* Player levels up, message explains levelling

Hey I'm curious. Can you open that container over there?

* Player opens it up, uncommon spell pops out

I don't know who you are, but no one has been able to open those containers for as long as I can remember.

Why not? It was easy.

* Tutorial about new spell button and how to use spells
